    <h3>My Interests</h3>
    <p>Hey there. My name is Victor Padilla. I am 26 years old and was born and raised in Atlanta. I have always dreamed of having my creative work published. Until I am able to earn enough to finish out my senior year, I will be using my time learning valuable skills that will provide me with a path for financial stability. Specifially about me, I enjoy watching news documentaries such as the ones created by Vice. I as well like to watch video about various video games lore, easter eggs, fun nerd stuff. I also enjoy traveling, experiencing new things, especially if they are cheap. Although it has been awhile, I really enjoy hiking, especially if it culminates in a beautiful view. </p>
